# Password-generator

**An amateur level attempt on a password generator**

**The code will contain the following python files** 

### Stage 1: Designing the Core working of a password Generator 

#### _Passgen.py_
This python files makes of the random function and is responsible for random password generation

The given constraints of the code will be using (a-z),(A-Z),(0-9),(symbols)
The code will shall take an user input denoting the number of characters, then create a password,which shall **mandatorily include 1 Capital letter, 1 small letter, digits and 1 symbol.**
It makes use of : 
- **Pass_gen function** : Which creates a random password from a set of characters 
- **Pass_check function** : Which checks the feasibility of the password, ensuring the required parameters are fulfilled 

### Stage 2: Adding GUI to it using Tkinter 
GUI using tkinter was made (dimensions are yet to be set, just an entry level GUI set-up). The GUI has 2 buttons, "Click me" which produces a randomised password and "delete" which resets the textbox for future outputs. It also has a quit button which destroys or exits out of the Event loop. 


(The given code is still under development)
